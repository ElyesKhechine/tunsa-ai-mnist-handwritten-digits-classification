**Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib Pyplot, Keras, scikit-learn, imblearn, Random Under-Sampling

## Introduction

This project focuses on enhancing handwritten digit recognition through the implementation of a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Leveraging a combination of state-of-the-art machine learning libraries and techniques, it aims to improve model robustness and accuracy for digit classification tasks.

## Project Scope

The project spanned from March 26, 2022, to March 27, 2022, and was conducted by a subteam of 3 members from the Tunisian Space Association (TUNSA)'s AI team. It involved data preprocessing, model development, training, and evaluation phases.

## Technical Details

- **Data Preprocessing**: Shuffled and balanced an MNIST dataset using random under-sampling, resulting in an equal representation of each digit class with 5,421 samples, thereby enhancing model robustness.
- **Custom CNN Architecture**: Developed a custom CNN architecture comprising convolutional, max pooling, and fully connected layers, with ReLu and Softmax activation functions, totaling 271,860 trainable parameters.
- **Model Training**: Trained the custom CNN for 5 epochs, achieving a training loss of 0.0315 and an accuracy of 99.26%.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Attained a remarkable 98.75% accuracy with a loss of 0.0584 on unseen test data, surpassing the industry standard for handwritten digit recognition.
